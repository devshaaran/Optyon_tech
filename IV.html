    <h2>Why Industrial visit ?</h2>
    <p class="para_why">
        Industrial visits! The term itself instils immense happiness and excitement in students. The idea of embarking on an educational trip encourages many. However, for some, this excitement is soon killed when they are not allowed to go for the industrial visit. Because of monetary and family reasons, students often avoid these visits. It is high time that you realise the importance of these visits and take them as an opportunity to learn about your dream career.

    <p class="para_why">

        Industrial visits offer a great source to gain practical knowledge. Students can observe and learn as to how theatrical concepts are put to into action, thereby aiding their practical learning. Students are exposed to real working environment and shown how things are done in an organisation. From the details about the management to the targets they achieve, everything is covered in these visits.
